 * Created with IDEA
 * Description:
 *      There are N network nodes, labelled 1 to N.
 *      Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w),
 *      where u is the source node, v is the target node,
 *      and w is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.
 *      Now, we send a signal from a certain node K. How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal?
 *      If it is impossible, return -1.
